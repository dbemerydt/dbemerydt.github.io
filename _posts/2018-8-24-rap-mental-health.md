Suicide rates have [risen sharply since the turn of the decade](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/suicide/), and that increase is especially alarming for young people. It's now the second most common way for [people between the ages of 15 and 35 to die](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2015-a.pdf).

Fortunately, this trend does seem to be getting attention in popular culture, possibly most notably in hip hop. One notable example was last year, when Logic released a track specifically aimed at suicide prevention, titled "1-800-273-8255", the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. In the months following [the lifeline's traffic rose enormously](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/logic-alessia-cara-song-drive-national-suicide-lifeline-calls).
