Suicide rates have [risen sharply since the turn of the decade](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/suicide/), and that increase is especially alarming for young people. It's now the second most common way for [people between the ages of 15 and 35 to die](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2015-a.pdf).

Fortunately, this trend does seem to be getting attention in popular culture, perhaps most notably in hip hop. One notable example was last year, when Logic released a track specifically aimed at suicide prevention, titled "1-800-273-8255", the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. In the months following [the lifeline's traffic rose enormously](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/logic-alessia-cara-song-drive-national-suicide-lifeline-calls).

It makes sense that this was so powerful. Hip hop must have a lot of influence over the U.S. population, considering that it [just became the most listened-to genre in the country](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/07/17/hip-hoprb-has-now-become-the-dominant-genre-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time/#437dba335383). Additionally, [many other prominent hip hop artists have recently taken to addressing mental health in their music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JTL5WgdDYk). 

I recently found myself captivated by this apparent uptick in mental health discussion in hip hop. It's well documented that [suicide spreads as a socially contagious phenomena](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207262/), but what about rappers talking about suicide, and mental health in general?

To help answer this question, the website [Genius.com](www.genius.com) seemed particularly useful. Genius is not only a user-friendly database for song lyrics, but it also contains crowd-sourced annotations that explain the meaning behind the lyrics. This is useful from a computational perspective because it's very difficult for a computer to detect symbolism and other devices rappers use to encode meaning. Take this Lupe Fiasco lyric and accompanying annotation, for example.

I probably couldn't find a way to get my laptop to detect that Lupe is convincing himself not to pull the trigger, but from the annotation, at least we can pull out the word "suicide".
