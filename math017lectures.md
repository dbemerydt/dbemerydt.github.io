Error at 22:50: I should not have corrected the formula. The formula was right, I just substituted in the numbers backwards. So for clarity, the formula should in fact be msf=(lsf)^D.

Note: This lesson was heavily inspired by a [video on the same topic by Grant Sanderson](https://youtu.be/gB9n2gHsHN4). If you're struggling with my explanation of these things, I recommend checking out this video instead. Grant's presentation is much more rehearsed and coherent than mine, but I think he blows past some steps that are not as trivial for us as they are for his audience.

If you're confused about the coffee mug (which I idiotically placed in view of the camera), it came with the pre-order of [an album I like.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Amerikkkan_Badass) I thought that was worth clarifying.
