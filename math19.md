## Current Instructions

### Practice for the quiz on 4-6
[Here are some nice practice problems.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-applications-derivatives/ab-related-rates/e/related-rates) The ones in the "advanced" section are notably harder than what will be on the quiz, so if you can figure those out you're probably good.

Solutions to classwork pending.

### Keep working through the practice if you need to
[Classwork from Monday 4-2](http://uvm.edu/~bfemery/Math019ICW04-02.pdf)
