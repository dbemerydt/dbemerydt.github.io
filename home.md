Hi, I'm Ben, an applied math Master's student at UVM. This website is still very much a work in progress, but it's growing into a collection of several principal components of my life. Above, one can navigate to information about myself, the courses I instruct, my research, and the events I organize, and below you'll find a few of my favorite social media platforms.
