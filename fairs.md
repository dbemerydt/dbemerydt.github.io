# **FaIRS** -- _Free food and Infosci Research Student seminars_.
![photo](images/fairs-banner.jpg)


Or something like that! A few times a semester, students in the greater INFO community can come learn about someone's research, eat free lunch, and support each other. 
<!-- I'm an interdisciplinary off-road cyclist and racer. Interdisciplinary because every year or so I have an identity crisis about which type of racing I want to do, and off-road because I like being in the trees or on the desert rocks. I've been racing endurance events since middle school circa 2007, and gravity events since college in 2012. -->
