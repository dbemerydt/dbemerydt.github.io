### Why I'm here

While earning my MS in applied mathematics, I do blatantly fun research with the [Computational Story Lab](http://uvm.edu/storylab), a team that works within the [Complex Systems Center](http://uvm.edu/~cmplxsys). My work on the team mainly focuses on using data science and mathematics to extract a deeper understanding of the global climate and earth system.

### A few more quick facts from which a bigger picture can be extrapolated

- I graduated from UVM in 2016 with bachelor's degrees in physics and statistics.

- I spent one summer working as a mountain bike guide in rural Colombia.

- I spent another summer helping teach astronomy to driven high school seniors in New Hampshire

- I race for the [UVM Cycling Team](http://uvm.edu/~cycling), for whom I've competed in collegiate national downhill and cross country MTB races. I've also done a 24-hour MTB race, and will do another upon the next opportunity.
