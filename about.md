### why I'm here

I spend an alarming amount of time thinking. At least it would be alarming without direction, which is why I'm now pursuing my {% raw %}<a href="http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/masters/" 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭="_𝐛𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐤" >MS in Complex Systems and Data Science</a>{% endraw %}. This allows me to take impossibly interesting classes and do blatantly fun [research](https://dbemerydt.github.io/research/) with the [Computational Story Lab](http://uvm.edu/storylab), a team that works within the {% raw %}<a href="http://vermontcomplexsystems.org" 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭="_𝐛𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐤">Complex Systems Center</a>{% endraw %}.

### some more data points for improved extrapolation

- I graduated from UVM in 2016 with [bachelor's degrees in physics and statistics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFxNaK0kHVG/).

- I spent one summer working as a [mountain bike guide](http://www.colombianbikejunkies.com/) in rural Colombia.

- I spent another summer [helping teach astronomy](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIlKWzrBmOJ/) to [driven high school seniors in New Hampshire](https://www.sps.edu/page/summer-asp/advanced-studies-program).

- I race for the [UVM Cycling Team](http://uvm.edu/~cycling), for whom I've competed in collegiate national downhill and cross country MTB races. I've also done a [24-hour MTB race](https://www.instagram.com/p/6OIVxFkHf6/), and will do another upon the next opportunity.

- I recreationally [ski jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jumping), and got my first opportunity to do so at [olympic magnitude](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be4VIpQH_yj/) in February 2018.
