### Announcement
There will be no graded HW due Wednesday, as I just now got WebAssign up and working, and I think the notice is too short to assign something with a grade for Wednesday. If you have time, however, please try the practice problems linked in the current instructions.

### Current Instructions
[Try these practice problems without a calculator (don't attempt to evaluate square roots, leave in terms of pi, etc).](http://www.uvm.edu/~bfemery/math10/PracticeProbs8-5.pdf)

These will not be graded, they are just for practice. I will upload my solutions tonight!
