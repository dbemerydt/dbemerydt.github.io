I'm an interdisciplinary off-road cyclist and racer. Interdisciplinary because every year or so I have an identity crisis about which type of racing I want to do, and off-road because I like being in the trees or on the desert rocks. I've been racing endurance-style events since middle school circa 2007, and gravity-style events since 

__Dirt roads are still roads.__

# Results
As I insist on continuing to show up to races, some of them going well is a statistical inevitability. Here are some recent examples.
