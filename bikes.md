I'm an interdisciplinary off-road cyclist and racer. Interdisciplinary because every year or so I have an identity crisis about which type of racing I want to do, and off-road because I like being in the trees or on the desert rocks.

__Dirt roads are still roads.__

# Results
I insist on continuing to show up to races, some of them going well was a statistical inevitability. Here are some recent examples.
