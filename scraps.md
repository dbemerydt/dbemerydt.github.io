SCRaPS is a biweekly gathering exclusive to students, undergrad and grad, for discussions about research, the universe, and everything. Also, we eat free pizza.

### Fall 2017 Presenters

We'll be holding SCRaPS every other Monday, starting on the 11th of September. Info on presentations will appear here.

As a special kickoff for the semester, UVM graduate Casy Brinkman will be speaking about her work with SETI - the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence.

"The Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC) is a research group within the UC Berkeley astronomy department, and work on the Breakthrough Listen project. At BSRC, we look for technosignatures of civilizations beyond Earth, primarily through the use of radio telescopes. In order to detect a signal, however, we must have a deep understanding of everything else producing radio emission, from RFI created on Earth to Pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts. My work at BSRC uses Pulsars as a calibration measure for the flux and polarization of our signals of interest that could potentially come from alien civilizations. "
