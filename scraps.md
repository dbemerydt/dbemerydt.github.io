SCRaPS is a biweekly-ish gathering exclusive to students, undergrad and grad, for discussions about research, the universe, and everything. Also, we eat free pizza.

"Despite​ ​their​ ​recent​ ​success,​ ​the​ ​systems​ ​that​ ​populate​ ​the​ ​machine​ ​learning​ ​literature​ ​remain 
brittle,​ ​fragile​ ​creatures.​ ​In​ ​highly​ ​sterilized​ ​environments​ ​they’ve​ ​proven​ ​remarkably​ ​proficient, 
and—like​ ​many​ ​optimized​ ​systems,​ ​ranging​ ​from​ ​calculators​ ​to​ ​airplanes—occasionally​ ​dwarf​ ​the 
abilities​ ​of​ ​humans,​ ​but​ ​fail​ ​catastrophically​ ​when​ ​exposed​ ​to​ ​problems​ ​and​ ​environments​ ​not​ ​seen 
during​ ​training.​ ​Further​ ​training​ ​can​ ​rectify​ ​this,​ ​but​ ​will​ ​invariably​ ​replace​ ​or​ ​degrade​ ​previously 
obtained​ ​knowledge​ ​unless​ ​the​ ​system​ ​is​ ​carefully​ ​engineered​ ​to​ ​preserve​ ​certain​ ​functions.​ ​This 
requires​ ​explicitly​ ​identifying​ ​the​ ​features​ ​that​ ​are​ ​most​ ​important​ ​for​ ​high​ ​performance​ ​on​ ​one​ ​task 
and​ ​protecting​ ​them​ ​from​ ​degradation​ ​while​ ​training​ ​for​ ​another.​ ​The​ ​model​ ​I​ ​propose​ ​is​ ​one​ ​in 
which​ ​these​ ​salient​ ​features​ ​are​ ​discovered​ ​by​ ​evolutionary​ ​selection​ ​and​ ​Bayesian​ ​inference,​ ​and 
culturally​ ​transmitted​ ​between​ ​populations​ ​of​ ​specialists​ ​by​ ​an​ ​evolved​ l​ ingua​ ​franca​ ​such​ ​that​ ​they 
can​ ​be​ ​woven​ ​together​ ​to​ ​produce​ ​multi-tasking,​ ​generalist​ ​agents."

"Self-assembling DNA nanostructures can solve complex computational problems and have the potential for revolutionary biomedical applications. They also generate hard combinatorial and topological problems requiring new mathematical theories to solve. This talk  will focus on DNA origami and new theories of knots in graphs arising from, and applied to, the origami design of self-assembling nanostructures."

"Renewable energy generation is growing at an incredible rate, but is still held back by a cost-effective energy storage method. The Energy Systems Lab at UVM (TESLA UVM) is investigating the use of household appliances to store energy, improving the reliability and cost of renewable sources, such as wind and solar. This can pass on great benefits to electrical consumers (that's you!). Find out how at the next edition of SCRaPS!"
### 9-25-2017 Ben Emery - Mapping the Teletherms and Teletherm flickering

Your very own SCRaPS director, Ben Emery, will be presenting his work, and likely reaching out to the crowd for help with where to proceed.
"The global climate has long been known to be a complex dynamical system, which despite decades of ongoing research, requires much further study for a complete understanding. We seek to further understand the dynamics of the global climate by examining the spatiotemporal behavior of what we call the Teletherms, the dates of the on-average hottest and coldest weather. By mapping a discontinuous jumping, or “flickering” behavior, we gain some insights about how the propensity for regime shifting is spatially distributed."
### 9-11-2017 Casey Brinkman - LITERALLY ALIENS

As a special kickoff for the semester, UVM graduate Casey Brinkman will be speaking about her work with SETI - the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence.
"The Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC) is a research group within the UC Berkeley astronomy department, and work on the Breakthrough Listen project. At BSRC, we look for technosignatures of civilizations beyond Earth, primarily through the use of radio telescopes. In order to detect a signal, however, we must have a deep understanding of everything else producing radio emission, from RFI created on Earth to Pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts. My work at BSRC uses Pulsars as a calibration measure for the flux and polarization of our signals of interest that could potentially come from alien civilizations."
